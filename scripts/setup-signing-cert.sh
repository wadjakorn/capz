# One-time setup: generate a FREE self-signed macOS code-signing certificate
# and push it (plus password + identity name) to this repo's GitHub Actions
# secrets so CI signs every release with a STABLE code identity.
#
# Why: ad-hoc signing ("-") gives a new cdhash every build, so macOS keys the
# Screen Recording (TCC) grant to that hash and the permission dies on every
# auto-update. A stable self-signed identity makes the grant survive updates.
#
# This does NOT notarize and does NOT remove the Gatekeeper "damaged" prompt on
# direct .dmg download — Homebrew install still strips quarantine. Only a paid
# Apple Developer ID + notarization removes that (see docs/SIGNING.md).
#
# Requirements: macOS, openssl, gh (authenticated with repo admin), this repo.
# Cost: $0. The cert is zero-cost to regenerate/rotate (run this again).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/setup-signing-cert.sh                 # generate + set GitHub secrets
#   scripts/setup-signing-cert.sh --print-only    # generate + print base64, DON'T touch GitHub
